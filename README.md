## Prerequsites : 

Python 3 Interpreter

## Steps to follow after downloading these files : 

1. If you download and store the folders and files in the same sequence as are in my repository then you can skip reading further to save your time.

2. If you want to arrange them manually or as you wanted, then please consider reading further.

## Additional files and folders : 

1. docs(Directory/Folder)
2. freegames(Directory/Folders)
(Else are game files)

Do not worry, I have given these two addional folders for graphics used in games in the same folder named "python Games Files". 

The main directory named "python Games Files" contains all additional folders mentioned below.

Note : "docs" and "freegames" (Not need to modify or run). Just paste these two folders in the directory where all the games files are being pasted. (If you try to manage folders or directories) 

Ant, Pacman , Pong, Tron these games requires those additional folders/diretories for graphics.

Enjoy!
